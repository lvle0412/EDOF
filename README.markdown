Introduction

This is a modified version of branch master. The branch assembles the branch StagePositionRecording. The program can be used to communicate with other programs to get the information whether that program is tapping the stage to give the worm a mechanical stimulation. The program will show the status of tapping machine and record these information to *.yaml file.
